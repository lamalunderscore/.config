### Part 2
#### Generic Machine Learning Model
This abstract class is supposed to be a developmet frame for a generic model. Since every model has to be trained and can predict something, these are the included functionality methods. There is also a property introduced in this class: the parameters. Any model that is trained trains these parameters, so they have to exist.

#### MultiLinearRegression Changes
This class has been adjusted to improve the style and implement the private variables as properties. We also copied our MSE code from the old main.py and implemented it as a function in the MultiLinearRegression class, since it is useful in any regression model
